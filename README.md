Find publicly accessible power sockets in your city!

Also known as **Project Thunderbolt app. 2**

Authors: [Iwo Bujkiewicz][Github Outfrost], [Szymon Abramski][Github Quanterro]

It will be the map of public places with public accessible power sockets to charge your phone or laptop.

It's another approach to Project Thunderbolt for another course at the University.

It didn't even end up as a compiling app... And it's dropped.

But there will be another approach... I'm sure about that xD
